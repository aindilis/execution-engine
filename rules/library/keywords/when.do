(when (I have a question)
 (log it with C-crerq))
(when (someone insults you or your project)
 (put on upbeat music playlist and take caffeine, then set about
  getting the AI to work))
(when (I give someone software on github to use)
 (test first on a VM to get everything working))
(when (I wake up)
 (record in Alexa that I woke up))
(when (I don't have the storage to work on packaging software)
 (maybe I should just write my own software in the meantime)
(when (I contemplate working on AI)
 (no one is going to do the work for me.  I must, as I did early
  on in 2005, write all the systems myself.  I must write the
  backup system, and finish the integration of KBS w/ Prolog, and
  finish the book reading program, etc.  It won't get done on
  it's own.))
(when (I am bored)
 (read books on things like Chess, Programming Languages,
  Catholicism, PDFs from arxiv.org in the ai section, digilib,
  etc.  In fact build out the system for tracking and reference
  reading and books.  Need a system for automatically computing
  citations from books, e.g. academician-cite-region.))
(when (I am unmotivated to work on my stuff)
 (A good way to motivate myself is to have to do some thing that
 I don't want to do, and then I will work on stuff I want to do))
(when (I want to work on AI but feel burnt out)
 (?))
(when (I'm not being productive)
 (try looking for code to incorporate from github)
 (try looking at PDFs from arxiv.org in the ai section, and
  download to desktop and process with `sentinel -d`)
 (browse through sandbox/external/git etc)
 (look for research on academic department homepages)
 )
(when (I'm not being productive enough, because I'm tired)
 (put on music, it pumps me up and I'm able to work))
(when (I am just kinda board, not being productive atm)
 (progn
  (get serious somehow)
  (read up on discipline)
  (executive function)))
(when (I need to be productive)
 (have caffeine))
(when
 (I have trouble getting started with being productive for the day)
 (progn
  (and
   (eat well if possible)
   (take an energy shot, but don't take two in one day or it
    backfires))
  (work on something that I find extremely interesting, or at
   least partially interesting as a way of getting started in a
   productive role, and then transition to the important stuff
   naturally by virtue of that fact that we'll come up against
   the limitations of the system)
  )
 )
(when
 (we are interrupted or sidetracked or waylaid or interdicted)
 (figure out what date we were set to do something, then
  use "git blame " function to tell us which date a given thing
  was added to our to.do files, then use this to restore
  ourselves to that time and begin getting things done again))
(when
 (I need to be productive)
 (progn
  (ensure that all resources are satisfied per the resource
   manager)
  (FIXME: add more items here)
  )
 )
(when (we are pressuring ourselves to get some specific task done
       to the point where we get nothing done)
 (remeber to relax and work on all sorts of problems, come up
  with reasons to justify why this approach works to myself in
  case I forget))
(when (not getting enough done)
 (sometimes taking a nap can help))
(when (I have food coma)
 (?))
(when (I need to relax)
 (see what-to-do))
(when (every last thing goes against us and I get frustrated)
 (?))
(when (you're not making much progress working on AI)
 (take a lot of caffeine, and eat, and that could help))
(when (you need to make yourself a todo list)
 (I'd make it based on all the things you wish you had time to do
  before you get to prioritizing or making it realistic))
(when (the weather is bad outside and you have to go somewhere)
 (check with that location whether it is closed due to the
 weather))
(when (we are getting no where by reading the definition of the
  rules of a project)
 (look for examples or a tutorial))
(when (I am trying to wake up but I'm too tired to get up)
 (and
  (play upbeat music)
  ))
(when (I haven't slept very much, i.e. 1 - 2 hrs)
 (don't exercise or have energy drinks that day))
(when (we are running low on common batteries and the finances
       allow)
 (reorder them))
(when (it is possible that an items battery has run out)
 (add task to check battery))
(when (an items battery has run out)
 (replace it as soon as feasible))
(when
 (tired and can't concentrate, want to work on AI but don't have
  the energy)
 (start with very small tasks, maybe you'll build up the energy))
(when
 (it is too late at night to get started with some work)
 (kmax-not-yet-implemented))
